# Planning a feature roadmap

## Introduction

Working with collaboration in a software building need some organization, is necessary to determine a action sequence in order to built all separated parts and then bring them up togheter

## Reasoning

I usually prefer to take that solution feature and tear apart every feature in a 'capsule' independent from each other, but every piece make your own job and pass the result forward

## Example

<img 
  src="./files/avaliacao_entrega.jpg" 
  alt="Sistema de avaliação de entrega"
  height="500px"/>

In this example above, the deliver review system, starts with the producer receiving some material with a message from the collaborator, depending on each material reference the view has to be adapted for better visualization and producer usability. 

### The roadmap

It be not so noticeable but, all data revolves around timeline, the other parts receives data, shows some interaction with the user and move the timeline, but if we need to develop a so big system have to be settle some sequence. An idea is to put on top of priority list the minor pieces and on top of that list to build the most hard that requires some major time and particular knowledge to bring from scratch, if there some partner available to help you it can take some other little pieces meanwhile you build the most crucial or showy feature.

In this case I'd prefer to built Label Review module, beginning on the responsive 3d visualization of the bottle and finishing on the approval/not approval updating the timeline which has been developed by my partner, after that, the Copy Review will begin on producer approving or sending changes to be made and finishing on the worker text input, the last one will be the communicator module, that will show every message sent from each side on a reduced window on the screen corner simulating a 'whatsapp' group which will help with platform humanization.

So the idea is to order the job needs in a sequence that will naturally fit into the already made work.
